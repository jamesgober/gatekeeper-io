## [Unreleased]

---

## [0.4.0] - 2026-11-09

The `web-net` feature moves to web-net 0.7.

### Changed

- `web-net` now depends on web-net 0.7 (was 0.3). Breaking for users of the
  feature: web-net's `Denial` is `Clone` only.
- `web::denial` attaches the refusal's `Set-Cookie` (a cleared session
  cookie) to the denial with `Denial::with_cookie`.

### Added

- `web_net::Identity::set_cookie` for `Identified`: web-net writes the
  cleared session cookie on the reply.

See [`docs/release/v0.4.0.md`](./docs/release/v0.4.0.md).

---

## [0.3.0] - 2026-11-08

Hardening: property tests for every invariant, fuzz targets for every parser, and benchmarks with measured numbers.

See [`docs/release/v0.3.0.md`](./docs/release/v0.3.0.md).

---

## [0.2.0] - 2026-11-08

Design lock: the public API settled with the neighbouring server and router crates, documented item by item, with examples.

See [`docs/release/v0.2.0.md`](./docs/release/v0.2.0.md).

---

## [0.1.0] - 2026-11-08

First working core: the types, the main path, and the in-memory stores, with unit and integration tests. For gatekeeper-io this includes the end-to-end sign-in scenario: sign in and out, forged and expired tokens refused, CSRF on login and logout.

See [`docs/release/v0.1.0.md`](./docs/release/v0.1.0.md).
